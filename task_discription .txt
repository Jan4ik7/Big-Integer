Task description
BigInteger
Condition
In this task, you have to write a gigachad from the world of numbers - BigInteger.

Requirements:
The solution should be in two files: big_integer.cpp and big_integer.hpp
Construction from std::string, int64_t.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo remainder (and their assignment versions). Dividing by 0 counts as UB.
Comparison operators (==, !=, >=, etc).
Increment, decrement (prefix, postfix), unary minus -num (no need for unary plus).
Output to a stream and input from a stream.


P.S
There are checks in the tests that the number -0 should not be there. It should be just 0 instead.
